---
We provide a robust and secure data management infrastructure for application developers. Open source developers use our free Fireproof core to build applications, while customers leverage our value-added tools and services to create, manage, and scale their projects. Fireproof wants to be transparent about our use of the Personal Data that is entrusted to us.



This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes the "Personal Data" that we collect about you, how we use it, how we share it, your rights and choices, and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. This Policy also outlines your data subject rights, including the right to object to some uses of your Personal Data by us. Please visit the Fireproof Privacy Center (Include link here)  for more information about our privacy practices.



“Account” means a unique account created for You to access our Service or parts of our Service.



“Application” refers to software programs created by customers of Fireproof, which use Fireproof as part of their data management solution. 



"Fireproof," “company,” "we," "our," or "us" means the Fireproof entity responsible for the collection and use of Personal Data under this Privacy Policy. It differs depending on your jurisdiction. 



"Personal Data" means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, and can include information that you provide to us and that we collect about you, such as when you engage with our services (e.g., device information, IP address).



"Services" means the products and services that Fireproof indicates are covered by this Policy, which may include Fireproof-provided tools, resources, and support for Application Developers. Our "Business Services" are Services provided by Fireproof to entities ("Customers") who directly and indirectly provide us with "End User" Personal Data in connection with those Customers' applications and activities. Our "End User Services" are those Services which Fireproof provides as a data processor for applications managed by Customers.



“Sub-Processor” means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Company. It refers to third-party companies or individuals employed by the Company to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on behalf of the Company, to perform services related to the Service or to assist the Company in analyzing how the Service is used. 



"Sites" refers to Fireproof Storage, accessible from [https://fireproof.storage](/), and the other websites, apps, and online services that Fireproof indicates are covered by this Policy. Collectively, we refer to Sites, Business Services, and End User Services as "Services."



Depending on the context, "you" means Open Source Developer, Customer, or End User. 



When you use the free Fireproof core to build applications, we refer to you as an "Open Source Developer." When you are part of a team that writes and deploys applications using Fireproof value-added tools and pays monthly membership and metered costs, we refer to you as a "Customer."

When you use applications managed by Customers and have no direct commercial relationship with Fireproof, we refer to you as an "End User." Depending on the activity, Fireproof acts as a "data controller" and/or "data processor” (or service provider). If you are on a team building applications that use Fireproof, Fireproof is a data controller of your account payment, metrics, team and other data, and data processor of your application data.



The "data controller" is the entity which determines the purposes and means of the data processing taking place. The "data processor" is an entity acting on behalf and under the instructions of a controller in processing personal data.



Fireproof is a data controller when it determines the purposes and means of the processing taking place. These data processing activities include (1) providing the Fireproof products and services, (2) monitoring and maintaining the Fireproof platform, (3) complying with legal or regulatory obligations applicable to data protection, and (4) analyzing, developing, and improving Fireproof's products and services. Please see the Fireproof Privacy Center for more information on Fireproof's controller activities.



Fireproof is a data processor when it processes application data on behalf of and at the direction of a Customer. Our Customers, who are Application Developers, direct us to process data in the context of their applications, which may include personal information of End Users.

* When accessing our sites from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application, mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, and, depending on your mobile device settings, we may be able to approximate a device's location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.

5. ## Data Retention and Security

Fireproof will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We store data on servers in the U.S. or any other country in which Fireproof or its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, or contractors maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that your personal information may be transferred to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.



Fireproof cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

For your convenience, our Site may provide links to third-party websites or services that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our services, including the information or content contained within them. Your browsing and interaction on any other website or service are subject to the applicable third party’s rules and policies, not ours. If you are using a third-party website or service, you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site or service before providing any personal information.

7. ## Children’s Privacy

Fireproof's services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

## California Residents

In accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Fireproof does not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (California Civil Code Sec. 1798.100 et seq.), nor do we sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined under California Civil Code Sec. 1798.83.

## EU Residents

Fireproof will subject all EU residents' personal information received via the Privacy Shield to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. Fireproof is subject to the investigative and enforcement authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Fireproof may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.



In accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Fireproof is committed to resolving complaints about our collection or use of your personal information, and you may contact us at privacy@fireproof.storage. Fireproof generally offers EU residents the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal data may be (i) disclosed to a third party or (ii) used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.



If you wish to opt out, you can follow the information in the sections called “Consent and Information Collection and Use“ and “Rights to Your Information” or contact us at privacy@fireproof.storage. The above choice/opt-out doesn't apply where the sharing of your personal data is with a third party who is acting as our agent (such as our service providers who perform services that help us to run our business). We will not provide your personal data to a third party under these circumstances unless we have a contract in place with that third party.
