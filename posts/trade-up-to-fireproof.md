Being a professional trader is a demanding job. Traders must navigate a complex ecosystem of real-time data, split second decisions, layered strategies and algorithms. According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091714/5-skills-traders-need.asp), professional traders need five primary skills: *Research, Analysis, Focus, Self Control, & Records Keeping.* Unfortunately, solid skills aren't the only ingredients required for success. You need ***a winning strategy***, and creating one requires: 

> *Creativity, the right tools, and no small amount of luck!* 

The difference between a profitable trader and loss-making one is often very slim, contributing to the stress associated with the occupation. It can feel like a dark, lonely road sometimes.

One thing a trader can do to increase their chances of success is painstakingly assemble their own collection of intricate rituals and bizarre talismans, designed to increase their good luck. Kidding! You can't actually control your luck, but you *can* increase your luck surface area, by optimizing your tools. They must be fast, reliable, intuitive, and above all, secure. As technology evolves, it continuously grants unique advantages to early adopters. Fireproof is part of the newest rising trend – software from the ‘local first’ movement that’s being adopted in financial circles. 

By eliminating the need constant communication with backend servers, Fireproof addresses two critical needs simultaneously: speed and security. This local-first approach minimizes latency, allowing traders to execute decisions with unprecedented speed. More importantly, it keeps proprietary algorithms and strategies exactly where they belong – under the trader's control. In an industry where intellectual property can make or break a firm, this level of security is not just an advantage; it's a necessity.

The benefits of Fireproof extend beyond the trading session. The intuitive API and flexible data model enable developers to iterate faster than ever – strategies can be tested & deployed as soon as they’re created. Fireproof's ability to sync across devices when needed ensures that traders, individually or in teams, have seamless access to data, locally or around the world. Lastly, Fireproof’s immutable transactions also assist with research, analysis, focus and records keeping, four out of the five requisite skills mentioned earlier. 

The team behind Fireproof has deep roots in the financial sector, evidenced by their growing list of clients including Jump Trading, a leader in quantitative trading. This focus has allowed them to tailor their product to the unique demands of professional trading. Their commitment to the industry is further demonstrated by spin-off products like QuickCheck, which applies the same secure, local-first principles to other financial operations. The hunt for the next ‘edge’ in trading is neverending.
