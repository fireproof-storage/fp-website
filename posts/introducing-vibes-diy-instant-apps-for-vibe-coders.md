We built something for the dreamers, builders, tinkerers, and late-night prompt whisperers out there. It’s called [Vibes DIY](https://vibes.diy). Vibes DIY is a new playground for generating shareable mini apps in seconds. It’s powered by AI, backed by Fireproof, and built for creators who want to turn an idea into something real—fast.

What’s more? It’s easy.

### Vibe Coding is for Everyone

The future is for vibe coders. Whether you’re a seasoned web dev or just want a fun app, vibe coding feels more like jamming in your friend’s garage than filing a TPS report. Fireproof isn’t just along for the ride—we’re here to turn up the volume. With Vibes DIY we’ve made app generation accessible even to your non-techie friends. 

### What Can You Do with Vibes DIY?

Whether you’re making a tool, a toy, a mockup, or a micro-SaaS—Vibes DIY lets you start at the fun part.\

Not sure what you’d like to build? Take an existing app and remix it! All you do is tell Vibes DIY what needs to change. It’s seriously that easy.

You can:

* **Generate apps with natural language** — Let AI handle the scaffolding
* **Pick your style** — Choose from existing design prompts or bring your own
* **Save automatically** — Your creations live safely in your browser
* **Fork the platform** — Open source means you can make Vibes DIY your own
* **Use any model** — Choose from OpenAI’s GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek, or anything available through OpenRouter

### Local-First, Fireproof by Default

Vibes DIY uses our local-first architecture, so your app is stored safely on your device. Behind the scenes, our resilient, secure, and syncable database takes care of the rest.

No cloud configuration. No backend setup. Just vibes.

### Why We Made This

We believe that building software should feel more like jamming in your buddy’s garage than filing a TPS report. With Vibes DIY, we’re giving you the amp and letting you plug in.

Whether you’re making a tool, a toy, a mockup, or a micro-SaaS—Vibes DIY lets you start at the fun part.
