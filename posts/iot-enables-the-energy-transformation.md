We are in the midst of the biggest energy transformation humanity has ever seen. From when our ancestors first put fire to use for warmth, light, and cooking until today, our primary sources of energy have been burning various things. Until now. The transition to electricity as our primary form of energy is [already](https://www.fmiblog.com/2024/10/18/global-heat-pump-market-set-to-surge-with-10-2-cagr-projected-to-reach-usd-136-2-billion-by-2034/) [well](https://ourworldindata.org/electric-car-sales) [underway](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/climate/clean-energy-milestone-ember/index.html). As we continue down this path, it’s possible that the flames powering our civilization will be replaced in the next 100 years or less. In this context, the term [Fireproof](https://fireproof.storage/posts/understanding-the-fireproof-value-proposition/) takes on a whole new meaning. We’re excited about the role we can play in transforming the energy sector! 

## With the world’s energy infrastructure becoming increasingly software driven, cybersecurity is more important than ever.

Solar, wind, and other forms of clean energy generate vast amounts of operational data that must be rapidly analyzed, to optimize production efficiency and equipment reliability. Real-time monitoring enables quick response to changing weather conditions, equipment issues, or grid demands, while historical analysis drives predictive maintenance and strategic planning. Because the wind doesn’t always blow, and the sun goes down every night, renewable energy systems require another component – storage. These systems must retain a portion of power they generate, so it can be used in between energy generating periods. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are popular approach. They require sophisticated data management for monitoring charge/discharge cycles, optimizing energy storage and distribution, or even supporting off-grid facilities. Fireproof can enable comprehensive monitoring of entire energy systems, optimizing energy production, battery performance, maintenance, and upkeep.

With the world’s energy infrastructure becoming increasingly software driven, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Alarmingly, much of the attack surface is outside your direct control – over 90% of energy companies that experienced multiple breaches were [compromised via 3rd party systems](https://www.secureworld.io/industry-news/third-party-risks-energy-sector). Fireproof's UCAN-based access control, secure Passkeys and distributed configuration management were designed to eliminate this risk. A local-first architecture ensures continued operation during network outages or [attacks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546821000495), with automatic synchronization when connectivity returns. Granular permissions and digital signing capabilities [prevent unauthorized access](https://www.energivolt.com/identifying-cyber-threats-energy-sector/) to critical systems and data. Encrypted data storage protects sensitive operational information, while real-time processing capabilities enable immediate decision support, even if you're offline. This type flexibility is a crucial characteristic of edge computing across all types of energy production and storage systems.

The raw ingredients for the energy transformation are here today, but there will be plenty of hurdles to clear in the coming years & decades. Our global energy needs are higher than ever before, and we face all the old familiar problems, plus some new ones.
