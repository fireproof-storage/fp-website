## About Fireproof

Fireproof is a lightweight embedded database that provides local-first live ledgers using object data storage and Git-like encrypted synchronization. It offers cryptographic causal consistency across browsers, edge functions, and any environment where TypeScript or JavaScript runs. The database is open source and available under the Apache/MIT licenses.

## Why People Care

Fireproof simplifies app development by providing an easy-to-use API, making it accessible for coders of any level to build enterprise-critical applications.

## What Makes Fireproof Unique?

Below are some core features of Fireproof, an outline of the developer experience, an introduction to the technical architecture, a few use cases and examples of Fireproof in the wild, a list of resources to get started, and a transparent acknowledgement of our current limitations along with future goals and a call to action.

## Core Features

### Data Model and Storage

* Uses a Git-like data model with content-addressed storage, enhancing data integrity and supporting deterministic merges.
* Implements Merkle Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to provide multi-writer safety, tamperproof data provenance, conflict tracking, and deterministic merging of data changes.
* Stores data as content-addressed encrypted blobs locally using IndexedDB in browsers or the filesystem in Node.js environments.
* Supports offline-first functionality, allowing applications to operate without a network connection and sync changes when reconnected.
* Employs ledgers as the unit of data sharing, access control, and maintaining a provable history of changes.

### Synchronization and Collaboration

* Offers live synchronization of data across clients, with automatic UI updates through reactive APIs.
* Synchronization is achieved via encrypted sync, ensuring that data remains secure during transmission.
* Supports deterministic, idempotent, associative, and commutative merges, ensuring consistent state across all clients regardless of the order of updates.
* Uses eager decryption during sync operations, currently requiring data to fit in memory but with plans to support larger datasets.
* Provides real-time collaboration features, making it suitable for building collaborative applications like chat systems or shared documents.

### Security and Access Control

* Data is stored and transmitted in an encrypted form, enhancing security and privacy.
* Implements end-to-end encryption, with plans to support key rotation and mature key management.
* Uses UCAN (User Controlled Authorization Networks) capability delegation for authorization, allowing for embedded authorization without relying on centralized resources.
* Access control changes are treated as data manipulations, enabling offline authorization changes and secure delegation.
* The system uses non-extractable key pairs generated by client devices for secure authentication and authorization.
* Fireproof leverages modern browser APIs like Passkeys and the Origin Private Filesystem to support embedded databases.

## APIs and Developer Experience

### Simple and Intuitive APIs

* Provides a minimalistic API for data operations, such as db.put({ hello: "world" }) for adding data and connect(db, remote) for syncing.
* Offers reactive APIs like db.subscribe(), enabling automatic UI updates in response to data changes.
* Includes query APIs with support for pagination and limits, helping manage large datasets and preventing data avalanches.
* Designed to make front-end development easier by handling live data sync and collaboration features internally.
* The database can function as an RPC bus, a pattern inherited from CouchDB, facilitating backend processes to subscribe to ledger updates.

### Platform and Environment Support

* Runs anywhere JavaScript runs, including browsers, Node.js, edge functions, and mobile apps.
* Compatible with React, providing hooks and utilities like useFireproof, useLiveQuery, and useDocument for seamless integration.
* Can be embedded in iframed applications and is being adapted for React Native and Socket Supply for mobile app support.
* Designed with the philosophy of putting "the smarts at the edge," emphasizing client-side processing over heavy backend reliance.
* Supports edge functions by configuring the database to read and write directly with the cloud store.

### Integration and Extensibility

* Supports multiple backend implementations, including S3, Cloudflare R2, AWS SAM templates, Netlify, and custom backends.
* Synchronization endpoints can use various protocols like polling and WebSockets.
* The sync endpoint uses minimal blob key/value and register APIs, which can be built on top of any raw key-value store with check-and-set semantics.
* Plans to offer a REST API in Fireproof Cloud for raw data queries without requiring local replication.
* Fireproof Cloud uses Cloudflare's R2 and Durable Objects for its backend infrastructure.
* Working on transparent replication to PostgreSQL JSON, facilitating easier adoption in existing infrastructures.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Synchronization and Conflict Resolution

* Each ledger replicates entirely during sync operations, with no sharding within a ledger.
* Synchronization can be configured via a centralized endpoint or potentially peer-to-peer, although P2P setups may require additional development.
* The merge algorithm ensures that once all updates are applied, all clients reach the same state, regardless of update order.
* The system handles multi-writer concurrency safely, making it suitable for collaborative applications.

### Storage and Encryption

* Uses content-addressed storage, where data is stored based on its content hash, similar to how Git operates.
* The storage engine writes encrypted blobs, and the backend does not need to parse or understand the data, enhancing security.
* Employs Merkle trees in its CRDT implementation to efficiently manage and synchronize data.
* Encourages a local-first approach to data handling, improving performance and reliability in web applications.



### Performance and Optimization

* Underlying data structures utilize asynchronous iterators, allowing for future support of streaming data and handling datasets larger than memory.
* Currently uses eager decryption, which may impact performance with very large datasets, but optimizations are planned.
* Supports limit parameters in queries to help manage and paginate large datasets.

## Use Cases and Examples

* Suitable for applications requiring data integrity, privacy, and security, such as financial applications.
* Already used in projects like [AI character chatbots](https://botcat.netlify.app/), [personal finance applications](https://fireproof.storage/posts/quickcheck:-print-checks-at-home/), and by [hedge funds](https://fireproof.storage/posts/use-case:-hedge-fund-strategy-approval-workflow-for-live-trading-desk/).
* Can act as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Large Language Models (LLMs) by storing and searching across vector embeddings.
* Provides an easy way to add live collaboration features to legacy dashboards or build new interactive tools.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

* Filtering data by specific criteria (e.g., messages since time T) is currently limited due to end-to-end encryption constraints.
* Revocation in access control is an area identified for further development.
* Subset synchronization is not yet implemented but is recognized as a necessary feature.
* Handling data larger than memory is currently limited but planned to be addressed with optimizations in decryption and data handling.

### Planned Features

* Implementing read/write access control on a per-ledger basis.
* Enhancing key management, including support for key rotation.
* Developing a PostgreSQL backend for more flexible and efficient data storage options.
* Exploring subset synchronization using research like G-Trees to optimize data sync operations.
